windows port..

Try winedbg as gdb frontend

got it running now.. (in wineconsole.. pdcurses seems not to work in xterm )backspace does not seem to work

what next?
watcom'ish W32 bild or Dos?

try alternative win32 PDCurses..

have to get pthreads dep out of libsacommon for dos compile...
also iconv...

sane defaults for windows fav and rem.db
perhaps expand ~ to %HOMEDIR% or sthg.. but rcfile..

charset conv for vt display
xterm supposedly has double height chars...
see if they can be used..
no.. only has double size and double width (no double height)

check those fread()s. _FORTIFY_SOURCE sez I should check return values

marry xine, xterm and dvbv-nr so I only have one UI...
can I have xine paint to the xterm window?
minimal xine client is easy, and may get commands 
via pipe or bidi-FIFO from nvbv-nr. 

somethings borken with ncurses(menu)
garbled wheen linking with libncursesw
ok when using libncurses
fixed.. was something borked on the linker cmdline..

I have an overflow in 
the EPG window. the event name had an L'032' 
it overflowed by one column to the right.
waddnwstr counts chars. is not the same as columns.
need some way to trim to spec num cols.
hope this works..
nope, seeing it again...
