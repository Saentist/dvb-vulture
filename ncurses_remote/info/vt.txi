The VT viewer can be entered from the favorite list or the master list.
If there are several text services stored for the chosen service, a selection menu is shown.
Pages may be chosen by entering a page number directly. @key{Left} and @key{Right}
proceed to previous and next page numbers. @key{Up} and @key{Down} browse through subpages.
It is common for the VT database to contain stale pages, as the server does not remove packets.
