This program is a dvb remote control client

It depends on libdmallocth(5), libpthread(0), libc(6)
and libsacommon
libsacommon is included

There is no configuration. Just type make. 
This will create executable and documentation. 
Source code documentation will appear in the doc directory. 
This requires doxygen. 
A program manual page will be created in the info dir in info and pdf formats. 
This requires makeinfo and texi2pdf. 

make main just compiles the executable. 
The executable is compiled with debugging information enabled. 
make docs will just create the documentation. 
make clean removes intermediary and backup files. 

make install installs the executable in /usr/local/bin/dvbv-nr
and the info page in /usr/local/share/info. 
The last step has to be done as root. Actually only this step is necessary. 
It will trigger the other stages as needed. 

To create a windows .exe
run make -f makefile.w32 in ../common
and here. the .exe should show up in the win subdir. 
It needs pdcurses and a bunch of other libs....
not all of them are downloaded automatically...
resulting .exe depends on a lot of dlls
have to fix this...
