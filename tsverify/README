tsverify
Transport Stream Verification program

checks for sync bytes and continuity counter correctness
and outputs locations on stdout.

May optionally output packets with wrong cc and non sync bytes to dump file.

May optionally output found sync correct ts packets to output file.
(=It tries to throw away garbage between packets..)

Can not reassemble faulty cc sequences.
