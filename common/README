This is a library of functions common to 
dvb streaming server and remote control client 

It depends on libdmallocth(5) and libc(6) 

There is no configuration. Just type make. 
This will create library and documentation. 
Source code documentation will appear in the doc directory. 
This requires doxygen. 

make main just compiles the library. 
The library is compiled with debugging information enabled. 
make docs will just create the documentation. 
make clean removes intermediary and backup files 
and source docs. 

make install installs the library in /usr/local/lib/libsacommon.so 
The last step has to be done as root. Actually only this step is necessary. 
It will trigger the other stages as needed.
