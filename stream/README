This program is a dvb streaming server

It depends on libdmallocth(5), libpthread(0), libc(6)
and libsacommon
libsacommon is included

There is no configuration. Just type make.
This will create executable and documentation.
Source code documentation will appear in the doc directory.
This requires doxygen.
A program info page will be created in the info dir in info and pdf formats.
This requires makeinfo and texi2pdf.

make main just compiles the executable.
The executable is compiled with debugging information enabled.
make docs will just create the documentation.
make clean removes intermediary and backup files.

make install installs the executable in /usr/local/bin/dvbv-stream
and the info page in /usr/local/share/info.
The last step has to be done as root. Actually, only this step is necessary.
It will trigger the other stages as needed.

A minimal debian startup script can be found in the ../debian directory.
