@node VT(buggy)
@section VT(buggy)
The server maintains a thread that listens for videotext packets and stores them to disk 
for later use. Clients may retrieve Vt packets independent of currently tuned services.
This does not work very well as it is rather slow and the datafile gets rather bloated as
packets do not get removed (ever). Additionally, Level 2.5 enhancement data causes problems 
as it tends to get corrupted.
The server may be configured to collect VT and EPG data when the last client has exited.
